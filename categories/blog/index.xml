      <description>*Indroduction*

In this article we will explain how to create a blog site with minimum cost and with absolutely no hosting server of our own.

*Tools Used*

- https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] : A fast and modern static website engine.
- Any text editor of your choice. I prefer https://atom.io/[Atom] because of its plugeable architecture and its in-built support for editing and previewing mark-down files.



*Steps Followed*

- Download and install https://gohugo.io/[Hugo]. More details provided in https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/[getting started] guide of Hugo.

- Once Hugo is installed, open a terminal and go the folder where you want to keep the code for your blog or static website.

- Run  `hugo new site &lt;your-site-name&gt;` to create a new website. It will create following directories in the folder:
[source]
    ----
    ├── archetypes
    ├── config.toml
    ├── content
    ├── data
    ├── layouts
    ├── public
    ├── static
    └── themes
    ----

- Now go to http://themes.gohugo.io/ and clone a theme of your choice in `themes` folder.

- Once done, copy the `config.toml` from the downloaded theme into the root folder of the the website and run `hugo server --buildDrafts` from the root directory. It will start the server on port 1313. You can access the site from `http://localhost:1313`

- To create a new blog entry, run `hugo new post/&lt;blog-file-name&gt;.md`. It will create a file in `content/post/` folder.

- Open the newly created file in any of the editor and start writing the content of the blog.

- Once you are done with your content, delete content of `public` folder and run `hugo` command to regenerate the files.

- Create a repo on https://github.com[Github] and check in the content of the `public` folder.

- Now go to you repository on https://github.com and create a new branch called `gh-pages`. Click on `settings` and go to `GitHub Pages` section of the page, you will see a message like `Your site is published at https://&lt;user_name&gt;.github.io/&lt;repo-name&gt;/`. You can use this link to access your static website or blog.

If you want to use custom domain please follow https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/[this]

I have included some links that can be helpful while following these steps. Please feel free to ask any questions or help.

Any feedbacks or suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
